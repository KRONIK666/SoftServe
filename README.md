SoftServe Academy Projects

This Repository shares my Demo Projects and some Algorithms that I presented during the course in SoftServe Academy.

Project 1 - FindingLowestCommonAncestor (Demo 1) <br />
A program that finds the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a Binary Tree structure.

Project 2 - HRManagementSystem (Demo 2) <br />
HR Manager is the User and has to manage the people at his company using Web Application Panel.

The hierarchy in the company includes the following roles:

•	CEO <br />
•	Delivery Director <br />
•	Project Manager <br />
•	Team Leader <br />
•	Senior <br />
•	Intermediate <br />
•	Junior <br />
•	Trainee

Each employee must have information about: name, position, salary, city, e-mail, phone, project name / without project and who is his manager. <br />
Trainee, Junior, Intermediate and Senior employees are part of team managed by a Team Lead. One Project Manager can manage multiple teams. Delivery Director is on top of multiple project managers. CEO is the head of the entire company. <br />
User must be able to add a new employee, see and edit the existing ones. <br />
User must be able to choose Trainee, Junior, Intermediate, Senior or Team Lead and see in which team they belong together with information who is their Team Leader, Project Manager, Delivery Director and CEO. <br />
